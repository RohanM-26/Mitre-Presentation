### Code Review Process

1. All pull requests must be approved by 2 other team member before merging. 

2. We will debug together to make sure any changes will not affect the origin branch and remove any debug statements.

3. We will review code together to make sure there is no dead code such as unnecessary variables and functions. We will also make sure there is no 
uncommented code.

4. We will review style and design choices and make sure what we are merging is what is best for our main branch.

5. We will make sure our variable names are consistent and descriptive.

6. In situations where we are together, we will use live share VSCode.

7. Each team member will try to keep pull request small to simplify our code reviews.
